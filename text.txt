Executive Summary: Inventory KPI Analysis and Optimization

Objective

The goal of this project was to analyze inventory data from various retail stores to identify inefficiencies and improve stock management. By leveraging SQL queries and trend-based analytics, we generated actionable insights using key performance indicators (KPIs) such as stockout rate, inventory age, inventory turnover, and low inventory detection.

Key KPIs and Insights

Stockout Rate

* Products such as  P0016 (Clothing)  experienced stockouts in  \~18%  of inventory records.
* This indicates demand is often unmet, potentially leading to revenue loss and customer dissatisfaction.

Inventory Age

* Several products in categories like  Toys  and  Electronics  showed an inventory age exceeding  20 days , highlighting slow movement and potential overstocking.
* Product  P0031  had high inventory age and low turnover, suggesting review of its stocking strategy.

Inventory Turnover

* The average turnover ratio across stores was  2.3 , with best-performing items exceeding  4.0 .
* Lower turnover (<1.5) was noted in Electronics and Winter seasonal items, indicating capital lock-up.

Reorder Point Alerts

* Using a 3-day lead time and 30-day average sales trend,  12+ products  were flagged for restocking.
* This included fast-moving SKUs such as  P0096 (Toys)  and  P0159 (Electronics) , ensuring timely replenishment and avoiding stockouts.

Recommendations

1.  Implement Dynamic Reordering 
   Use trend-based reorder points to auto-trigger restocking when stock drops below threshold.

2.  Reallocate Overstocked Inventory 
   Shift slow-moving items from stores with high inventory age to regions with greater demand.

3.  Prioritize High Turnover Items 
   Allocate more shelf space and reorder budget to products with turnover > 3.5.

4.  Address Frequent Stockouts 
   Increase buffer/safety stock for high-demand items like  P0016  and adjust supplier frequency.

Conclusion

This project demonstrates how data-driven inventory management using SQL and pandas can reduce inefficiencies, improve service levels, and inform stocking strategies. With minimal automation, retail businesses can proactively manage inventory across stores and regions.
